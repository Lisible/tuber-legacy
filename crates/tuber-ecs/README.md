# tuber-ecs

tuber-ecs is the entity component system used by tuber. This is my first usable ECS and it is heavily inspired by hecs 
as I used it as learning material.


**This is a toy ecs for a toy engine so don't expect much from it.**



If you want a real ECS to work with please use one of these:

- [hecs](https://github.com/Ralith/hecs)
- [legion](https://github.com/amethyst/legion)
- [specs](https://github.com/amethyst/specs)
